# Do or Drink
Drinking game for couples! Don't pay $25 dollars for a card game when you can just play this. Or do, it's your money.
Do this for a night in when you don't want to leave the house or when going out to dinner isn't interesting enough.
## How to Play
The game will first open and explain the basic directions. You will press enter to continue. Then it will prompt you to enter each player's name like this:
```
Enter Player 1's name:
Jack
Enter Player 2's name:
Jill
```
The game will reiterate the directions: there are 3 prompt levels to choose from. Each player takes turns choosing a level and either doing the challenge/prompt or choosing to pass it and drink instead. Points are only awarded if they DO the prompt.
### Things to Remember:
- Press [enter] when you want to submit your response
- You should only enter 1, 2, 3, or "end" when asked for the prompt level you want
- Enter [o], [i], or type [end] when you have to choose to DO or DRINK. The first two choose DO or DRINK, respectively. Typing "end" terminates the game and you receive player scores and the winner.
- The game will end automatically if you run out of prompts
